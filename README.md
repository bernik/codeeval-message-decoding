# message-decoding

my solution of codeeval [message decoding](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/36/) challenge

## Usage

### with leiningen 
    $ lein run [path]
### with uberjar
    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar message-decoding-0.1.0-standalone.jar [path]

## Options

path - path to input data file

### Might be Useful

If you, like me, want to submit clojure solution to codeeval, don't. 
They will say that challenge is *partially* solved because of memory consumption and time.
Looks like codeeval [is broken](https://getsatisfaction.com/codeeval/topics/clojure_time_memory_stats_seem_wrong) for clojure.
